# C# Windows Forms Example Applications

In this repo I've put some examples of **C# applications** made under **Visual Studio 2015** :

* [Windows Forms with Database example application](../../tree/master/WindowsFormsWithDatabase/WindowsFormsWithDatabase)
  is an app which uses **Microsoft SQL Server 2014** as database, it has 2 tables Items and Lists which are related by     foreign key (one-to-many - one list can have many items). Program has simple CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) on     both tables. It also can be minimized to tray.

* [Simple Console Application] (../../tree/master/ConsoleApplication1/ConsoleApplication1)
  is simple application which outputs data to the console, it doesn't use any GUI elements.
  App shows on examples how to use inheritance, partial classes, sealed, abstract, override etc.
